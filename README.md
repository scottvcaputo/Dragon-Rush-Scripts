## Inspiration

- I have always been interested in games but have always lacked the knowledge to understand all that goes into them. With a lot of commitment and passion, I have grow to better understand them and begun to gain a better idea of all the goes into them. This is a simple exmaple where I wanted to better understand navigating within Unity, coding in C#, and working with my own custom art. This project allowed me to immediately begin a new much larger game development project that is even more exciting.
